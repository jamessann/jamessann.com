        <p class="lead">These are my personal recommendations that have broadened my perspective on all aspects of design, life & pop culture, that I continually come back to time and time again. It is not, by any means, an exhaustive list nor without subjectivity. I’m also open to suggestions, so if you have further recommendations, <a href="https://twitter.com/james_sann">please reach out to me on Twitter</a>.</p>

                <h3>How Buildings Learn</h3>
                <span>By Steward Brand</span>
                <p>I was recommended this book by a number of people as the analogies in building digital design systems aren't that dissimilar to good architecture. Architecture that adapts to human needs rather than dictating how people <em>should</em> live. People knock down partitions, re-structure their rooms to suit their ways of living so buildings should enable this.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>The Design of Everyday Things</h3>
                <span>By Don Norman</span>
                <p>Now in a revised edition, Don Norman's fantastic book on human psychology and technology is a must-read. Understanding how humans perceive and react to objects around them is imperative to good design and Norman showcases a number of good and bad examples and the reasons why. You can't design a great, intuitive product if you don't fundamentally understand your users first.</p>

            {{< figure src="recommended-user-experience-team-of-one.jpg" alt="The User Experience Team of One" >}}
            <div>
                <h3>The User Experience Team of One</h3>
                <span>By Leah Buley</span>
                <p>A fantastic practical guide, especially for digital product designers as it covers a wide variety of UX related activities and philosophies. And it's not just for newcomers. There's some great advice in here around design evangelism and growing your career.</p>
            </div>

            {{< figure src="recommended-refactoring-ui.jpg" alt="Refactoring UI" >}}
            <div>
                <h3>Refactoring UI</h3>
                <span>By Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger</span>
                <p>It's actually really tricky to find a modern book about user interface layout, practical methodologies to improve the visual design of your work. There are many graphic design books which teach you the fundamentals but many of them lack the modern digital aspect. However Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger's book covers a range of topics including modern user interface visual gestalt, colour theory, typography and more.</p>
            </div>

            {{< figure src="recommended-just-enough-research.jpg" alt="Just Enough Research" >}}
            <div>
                <h3>Just Enough Research</h3>
                <span>By Erika Hall</span>
                <p>Whilst I'm not a great design researcher, I have been told by many who are that Erika's Hall's (now second edition) book is a great starting point into various research methodologies. This practical book will give you enough ammunition to convince those in business the value of user research and why it's imperative to effective product design.</p>
            </div>

            {{< figure src="recommended-start-with-why.jpg" alt="Start with Why" >}}
            <div>
                <h3>Start with Why</h3>
                <span>By Simon Sinek</span>
                <p>better, to lead better, to create better experiences. In this book, Sinek asks us to start thinking more deeply about "Why do we do what we do" not "What we do". Sounds almost obvious but show me the benefits as a user, not a feature list</p>

            {{< figure src="recommended-art-of-looking-sideways.jpg" alt="The Art of Looking Sideways" >}}
            <div>
                <h3>The Art of Looking Sideways</h3>
                <span>By Alan Fletcher</span>
                <p>I've had this big ass book for many years, since University and it's a great reminder to always look at life from various perspectives. It's not a book for reference — it's a book to open randomly, to get re-inspired by variety of thought, to open up areas of creativity.</p>

                <h3>Design Better</h3>
                <span>Invision</span>
                <p>The most recent season of the Invision Design Better was all about the connected workflow — how designers can work more effectively and efficiently with their engineering and product counterparts. Hosted by Aarron Walter and Eli Woolery, they chat to a number of product design leaders. I found Josh Ulm's chat super insightful.</p>

                <span>Intercom</span>
                <p>Understanding the product lessons shared by the team at Intercom is super insightful. The podcasts cover a range of topics but I'm partial to the one's hosted by co-founder Des Traynor and SVP of Product, Paul Adams, as they are super transparent about the product successes and failures over time, the lessons learnt, and how the company is run.</p>

                <p>I keep up with the state of front-end with CSS Trick's owner Chris Coyier and Paravel developer Dave Rupert in their entertaining and engaging podcast. They bring their own charm to the show, cover more front-front end discussions which is right up my alley, and absolutely no pretension.</p>

        <span>Last updated — 01 October 2020</span>
        <section class="recommended-summaries">

            {{< figure src="recommended-jaws.jpg" alt="Jaws" >}}
            <div>
                <h3>Jaws</h3>
                <span>(1975)</span>
                <p>The very first Hollywood blockbuster, made by a then 27-year-old Steven Spielberg is an absolute masterclass in suspense that is unsurpassed 45 years later. The filmmakers had the odds against them yet with the help of Spielberg's editor Verna Fields, they demonstrated that less is more. A brilliant cast, a filmmaker with something to prove, John William's iconic score, I watch this every year in the summer. Because perfection never tires.</p>
            </div>
            
            {{< figure src="recommended-terminator.jpg" alt="Terminator" >}}
            <div>
                <h3>Terminator</h3>
                <span>(1984)</span>
                <p>Despite countless awful sequels (except <em>T2</em>), the original James Cameron 1984 film is more a horror film than anything. It put both Cameron and Arnold on the world map but also introduced us to perhaps one of the best movie creations ever put to film — The T-800 endoskeleton. It's also incredibly relentless, dark, with a fantastic mythology that translates perfectly to the world of sci-fi cinema — synthetic advanced robot intelligence than turns on humanity.</p>
            </div>

            {{< figure src="recommended-straight-story.jpg" alt="The Straight Story" >}}
            <div>
                <h3>The Straight Story</h3>
                <span>(1999)</span>
                <p>Trying to name the best David Lynch project is like trying to name your favourite child. It's just not possible. His filmography is like no other too. Most are non-linear and abstract. And most of the time he invites the viewer on a journey as their own detective. But in the case of <em>The Straight Story</em>, Lynch fashions an absolutely beautiful slice of Americana and paints an extremely human portrait of the elderly  Alvin Straight. Straight decided in 1994 to ride across Iowa and Wisconsin on a lawn mower to go visit his brother. Along the way, Alvin meets a number of people and reflects on his life and parts wisdom along the way. Why I often recommend this one over other Lynch films as its a seldom seen release in his impressive resume and it's bursting with humanity.</p>
            </div>

            {{< figure src="recommended-before-sunrise.jpg" alt="Before Sunrise" >}}
            <div>
                <h3>Before Sunrise</h3>
                <span>(1995)</span>
                <p>Of course I'm going to recommend the complete <em>Before</em> trilogy if you've never seen them but the original film will always be my favourite. Richard Linklater's almost voyeuristic journey into the young blossoming relationship between Jessie and Celine is always a delight. They walk around the streets of Vienna, slowly get to know one another, and really just talk... That's it. It's so simple yet the little nuances that both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy bring to the roles is cinematic magic. That Vienna backdrop doesn't hurt one iota either.</p>
            </div>
            
            {{< figure src="recommended-lost-in-translation.jpg" alt="Lost in Translation" >}}
            <div>
                <h3>Lost in Translation</h3>
                <span>(2003)</span>
                <p>Sofia Coppola's perfect encapsulation of the ageless feelings of numbness, uncertainty and aimlessness at various times in your life is richly brought to the screen with fantastic visual storytelling and two wonderful central performances from Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray. Sofia runs the gauntlet of emotions throughout from introspective wanderings through to tiny moments of elation. It's also quite rare to get equal perspectives in films from the younger and older generations.</p>
            </div>
            {{< figure src="recommended-halloween-1978.jpg" alt="Halloween 1978" >}}
            <div>
                <h3>Halloween</h3>
                <span>(1978)</span>
                <p>So many of the films I recommend are typically those which are imitated yet rarely surpassed. There's a reason why John Carpenter's original <em>Halloween</em> gets taught in film classes even to this day, especially within the horror genre. Again, it's another film from a young hungry director with incredible talent on display, making history yet again. Carpenter's use of tension, restraint, light and shadow, the mystery of Michael Myers and that iconic score is what makes the original <em>Halloween</em> one of the all-time greats.</p>
