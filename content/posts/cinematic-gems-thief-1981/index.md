<p class="lead">The following are bite-sized appreciations of cinema I'm particularly fond of.  Films that stand the test of time, despite made <em>of</em> a time. Pieces of cinema that are often seldom seen by the masses.  Hopefully, you'll discover a new cinematic experience or revisit a film you might have overlooked.</p>

<h2>Plot summary</h2>

<blockquote>Frank (James Cann) is an expert professional safecracker, specialized in high-profile diamond heists. He plans to use his ill-gotten income to retire from crime and build a nice life for himself complete with a home, wife and kids. To accelerate the process, he signs on with a top gangster for a big score.</blockquote>

<h2>Why you should see it</h2>

<p>It still boggles my mind that <em>Thief (1981)</em> was director Michael Mann's feature film debut.  It has all the cinematic virtues you'd expect from a seasoned director — A great script, atmospheric cinematography, excellent performances, and a seminal film score (by Tangerine Dream). Although Mann has gone on to make other higher-profile and arguably more polished works including <em>Manhunter (1986)</em>, <em>Heat (1995)</em>, <em>The Insider (1999)</em>, and <em>Collateral (2004)</em>, it's hard not to feel like the quaint nature of the film is also its greatest asset.</p>

<p>Hands down, this is my favourite James Caan performance outside of <em>The Godfather</em>. He perfectly embodies Frank's tough personification. Just like in this film's spiritual connection - <em>Heat (1995)</em>, the film has a diner scene all about character building. It's one of those moments to let the actor truly shine and Caan nails it. Also, watch for a cameo from Willy Nelson. Yes that Willie Nelson... He's actually incredible in this. The film is also the debut of actors Dennis Farina, William Petersen, James Belushi, and Robert Prosky (particularly great here).</p>

<p>The cinematography is drenched in mood and atmosphere. Rain-soaked Chicago streets, neon lights, shallow depth of field, glorious Panavision Panaflex Gold film. There's something about those film cameras and lenses that you just don't get from digital. We all love Nicolas Winding Refn's <em>Drive (2011)</em>. Think of this as <em>heavy</em> inspiration for all of his films.</p>

<h2>The soundtrack</h2>
<p>German electronic music masters <em>Tangerine Dream</em> scored the entire film and is up there as one of my favourite scores from the band. It was clearly mistakenly nominated for a Razzie in 1981 but it's actually perfectly suited for the mood and atmosphere Mann was trying to convey. <em>Stranger Things</em> composers cite Tangerine Dream as massive influences.
