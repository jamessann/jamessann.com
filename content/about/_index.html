    <h1>Delicious to meet you  <a href="/about/#footer"> *</a></h1>

    <p class="lead">Hi, I‚Äôm James ‚Äî Product Principal Visual Designer at MYOB, based in Melbourne, Australia. Ever since joining the company just over 5 years ago, my mission has been to scale our design language throughout our complex browser-based product range.</p>

    {{< figure src="2019-profile.jpg" alt="James Sann profile" >}}

    <p>Professionally, I believe in cross-functional, collaborative teams, who share goals and accountability across disciplines. I am passionate about designing at scale, seeing how design can impact large (and small) business practices (ie <a href="https://www.designbetter.co/designops-handbook">DesignOps</a>), and improve the customer experience.</p> 
    
    <p>I spend most of my days crafting & supporting our newer visual languages for browser and mobile experiences, mentoring the design team at large from a visual perspective and tooling, as well as other visual designers around systems thinking, helping guide a strong culture of critique within our team, as well as gaining as much data as I can to help inform decision making.</p>

    <p>Being a designer in the product space for me is so much more than any single speciality. Right now, however, I'm focusing my attention on leading the product visual language and being part of design leadership but that might not always be the case. The industry is constantly evolving and I plan to evolve with it. My background is multi-disciplinary as I've practiced in front-end, product and visual design, art direction, research, and various UX related activities throughout my career.</p>

    <p>I'm happiest in that <em><strong>intersection between design and development</strong></em> and helping bridge those gaps, whilst realising and overseeing high-quality, crafted experiences. I do what‚Äôs fun, accessible & needs to get done.</p>

    <p>I don‚Äôt believe in <a href="https://www.smartcompany.com.au/startupsmart/advice/leadership-advice/managing-people/what-atlassian-did-when-they-realised-theyd-hired-an-arsehole/">brilliant arseholes</a>, I feel motivated when working with open, collaborative, inclusive people who display good amounts of empathy for others, and most of time, there is usually an ‚Äúit depends‚Äù to solving problems.</p>


    <h2 >Personal Life</h2>

    {{< figure src="hoops.jpg" alt="Hoops wondering through the family creek" caption="Hoops wondering through the family creek" >}}

    <p>I have <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lyndsaymakes/">an incredibly talented wife</a>, an insanely great 2 y/o son, and humbled and amazed everyday by what they bring into my life. I am truly blessed.</p>

    <p>Lately, when I‚Äôm not working, I‚Äôm spending time with family and friends, making home movies with the little one & absorbing a tonne of visual culture. Every day I'm learning how to effectively build digital products and teams at scale and getting outdoors as much as humanly possible üåû</p>

        <li>It's design concept #46 of this 2020 site and the 5th time I've re-built it this year. I've gone large, small and now ‚Äî minimal.</li>
